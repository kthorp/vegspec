# vegspec
A compilation of spectral vegetation indices and transformations in Python

The goal of the vegspec package is to encapsulate computations of 1) more than 145 published spectral vegetation indices and 2) several published pretreatment transformations for vegetative spectral reflectance data.

Scientific background material for the methods implemented in the vegspec package is given [here](http://github.com/kthorp/vegspec/tree/main/docs/document.pdf).

## Source Code
The spectral methodologies are contained in one Python module (i.e., [vegspec.py](http://github.com/kthorp/vegspec/tree/main/src/vegspec/vegspec.py)). The module defines a class (i.e., `VegSpec`) to encapsulate all the computations for one vegetative reflectance spectrum. To analyze sets of multiple spectral measurements, users can develop a list of unique `VegSpec` instances for each measurement. At minimum, each `VegSpec` instance requires inputting two 1-dimensional lists that specify the spectral reflecance factors and associated wavelengths.

The source code is available [here](http://github.com/kthorp/vegspec/tree/main/src/vegspec/vegspec.py).

## Install
`pip install vegspec`

## Quickstart

### Import the package
`import vegspec as vs`

### Instantiate a VegSpec class
`spectrum = vs.VegSpec(wl,rf)`

where required inputs are defined as follows:

* wl : list, Wavelengths (nm) corresponding to the data in rf
* rf : list, Reflectance factors (0 to 1) for a single spectral scan

Other optional arguments for the `VegSpec` constructor are as follows:

* fs1 : int, optional, Filter size for Savitsky-Golay first derivatives, (default = 7)
* po1 : int, optional, Polynomial order for Savitsky-Golay first derivatives, (default = 2)
* fs2 : int, optional, Filter size for Savitsky-Golay second derivatives, (default = 15)
* po2 : int, optional, Polynomial order for Savitsky-Golay second derivatives, (default = 2)
* wlblu : float, optional, Primary wavelength of visible blue light (nm), (default = 480.)
* wlgrn : float, optional, Primary wavelength of visible green light (nm), (default = 550.)
* wlred : float, optional, Primary wavelength of visible red light (nm), (default = 670.)
* wlnir : float, optional, Primary wavelength of near-infrared light (nm), (default = 800.)
* solslp : float, optional, Slope of the soil line, (default = 1.166)
* solicpt : float, optional, Intercept of the soil line, (default = 0.042)
* getlirf : boolean, optional, If True, compute log inverse reflectance, (default = True)
* getcrrf : boolean, optional, If True, compute continuum removed spectra, (default = True)

The `VegSpec` class constructor will automatically compute all spectral vegetation indices and spectral data pretreatment transformations unless optional arguments (i.e., `getlirf` and `getcrrf`) are changed to `False`. If increased computational efficiency is needed, consider changing `getcrrf` to `False`.

### Access the results
```
for key in spectrum.indices.keys():
    print(key+',{:f}'.format(spectrum.indices[key]))
```

`print(spectrum.rfd1)`

The VegSpec class stores the computational results in the following attribute variables:
* rfd1 : numpy.ndarray, A 1D array of the Savitsky-Golay first derivative of rf
* rfd2 : numpy.ndarray, A 1D array of the Savitsky-Golay second derivative of rf
* lirf : numpy.ndarray, A 1D array of the logarithm of inverse rf (log10(1/rf))
* lirfd1 : numpy.ndarray, A 1D array of the Savitsky-Golay first derivative of lirf
* lirfd2 : numpy.ndarry, A 1D array of the Savitsky-Golay second derivative of lirf
* crrf : numpy.ndarray, A 1D array of the continuum removal of rf
* indices : dict, A dictionary of 145+ published spectral vegetation indices

For further information on the keys of the `indices` attribute, see the documentation [here](http://github.com/kthorp/vegspec/tree/main/docs/document.pdf).
